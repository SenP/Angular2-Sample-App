# Angular2-Sample-App

This is a sample app using Angular2 RC1

It uses http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com to simulate HTTP calls.

Features:

- Show navigation bar with links for Users and Posts views
- Users View:
    - Show list of users 
    - Edit and Delete links for each user
    - Add a new User using a new form
- Posts View:
  - Show list of posts
  - Filter Posts by User
  - Pagination of Posts
  - Show associated comments on a Post when clicked

As the backend is read-only, Add/Edit/Remove actions are simulation only.
