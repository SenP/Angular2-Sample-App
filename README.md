# Angular2-Sample-App

This is a sample app using Angular2 RC1

It uses "http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/" to simulate HTTP calls.

Features:

- Show navigation bar for Users and Posts views
- Show list of users with edit and delete links
- Add a new User
- Show list of posts
- Filter Posts by User
- Pagination of Posts
- Show associated comments on a Post when clicked

As the backend is read-only, Add/Edit/Remove actions are simulation only.
